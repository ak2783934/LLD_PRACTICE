## Functional requirements
1. Multiple lifts controls 
2. Optimize to minimize waiting time
3. Can go up and down. 


## Non functional requirements
1. Can be used for multiple lifts at once. 
2. Fault tolerant, if some lift broke, others should work as expected. 
3. Handle concurrent requests
4. Maintain elevator state (idle, moving, stopped)
